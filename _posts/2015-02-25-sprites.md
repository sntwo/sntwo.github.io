Previously I managed to draw a blue screen.  On to something slightly more complicated!  First, some housecleaning - I
changed the prefix for my engine classes to Hg to be a little more meaningful, deleted some extraneous class properties 
that I didn't need to keep references around for, and also broke HgSceneNode out into its own file apart from HgNode.

First, a trick - ultimately most of the customization for the draw engine should be in subclasses of HgNode, so in order to keep them as simple
as possible I'm going to abuse the relationship between HgNode and its topmost parent, an HgScene, to automatically provide
variables to the node as needed.  Example:

```swift
class HgNode {
  //stuff omitted...
  
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  //convenience variables that are overriden by the top level scenenode
  var device:MTLDevice { get { return parent!.device } }
  var library:MTLLibrary { get { return parent!.library} }
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
}
```

And in HgScene, the corresponding override tied to an initialized property:

```swift
class HgSceneNode : HgNode {

  //stuff omitted...
  weak var viewController:HgViewController!
  override var device:MTLDevice { get { return viewController.metalLayer.device } }
  
  var defaultLibrary: MTLLibrary
  override var library:MTLLibrary{ get { return defaultLibrary} }

  init(controller:HgViewController){
    //stuff omitted...
    commandQueue = viewController.metalLayer.device.newCommandQueue()
    defaultLibrary = viewController.metalLayer.device.newDefaultLibrary()!
    super.init()
  }
}
```
Now any node can just call the library without having to pass a reference around to the scene or whatever.
